ner model code -  Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The code begins by importing the necessary libraries: `csv` for reading training data from a CSV file, `spacy` for natural language processing, `random` for shuffling the training data, and `Example` from `spacy.training.example` for creating training examples.

2. The function `offsets_to_biluo_tags` converts the entity offsets to a list of BIO (beginning-inside-outside) tags. It takes a spaCy `doc` object and a list of `entities` as input and returns a list of tags.

3. The function `train_ner_model` trains a named entity recognition (NER) model using the provided training data. It takes `training_data` as input, which is a list of tuples containing the full text, masked text, entity spans, and other information.

   - It initializes a blank NER model using `spacy.blank("en")`.
   - It adds the NER component to the pipeline of the model.
   - It extracts the unique entity labels from the training data and adds them as labels in the NER component.
   - It prepares the training data in spaCy format by converting the entity spans to the required format.
   - It trains the NER model using the FastText algorithm for a specified number of iterations.
   - Finally, it returns the trained NER model.

4. The code reads the training data from a CSV file named `data.csv` and stores it in the `training_data` list. The CSV file should have columns for full text, masked text, entity spans, PII (Personally Identifiable Information) entities, and other entities.

5. The `train_ner_model` function is called with the `training_data` to obtain the trained NER model.

6. The trained NER model is saved to disk using the `to_disk` method, and it is stored in a directory named `ner_model`.

7. The code tests the NER model on a sample text by creating a spaCy `doc` object using the `ner_model` and the sample text.

8. The `masked_text` variable is initialized with the sample text. Then, for each entity (`ent`) in the `doc.ents`, the corresponding entity text is replaced with the string "{{MASKED}}".

9. Finally, the `masked_text` is printed, which contains the sample text with the identified entities replaced by "{{MASKED}}".

This code trains a NER model using the provided training data and demonstrates its usage by masking the entities in a sample text.
